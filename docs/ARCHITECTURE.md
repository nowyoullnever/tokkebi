# Architecture (P02.8)

`tokkebi` is a C++20/iPlug2 project with these target names:

- `tokkebi-app`: Standalone on Windows and macOS.
- `tokkebi-vst3`: VST3 on Windows and macOS.
- `tokkebi-au`: AUv2 on macOS only.

All targets share `src/app/tokkebi.cpp`, `src/app/tokkebi.h` and `src/app/config.h`. No duplicate DSP source or compatibility wrapper is maintained.

## Theme foundation

`src/ui/theme/Theme.h` owns the immutable twelve-color palette, semantic Light/Dark token sets, WCAG contrast helpers, typography roles and logical geometry tokens. Controls retrieve `Tokens` from a local `ThemeMode` and must not place raw brand colors in rendering code.

## Shared UI shell

`src/ui/AppShell` is the single IGraphics control used by Standalone, VST3 and AUv2. `NavigationState` is owned by each shell instance and contains the selected tab, keyboard focus and ephemeral theme mode. `ShellLayout` is a pure, deterministic calculation layer tested independently at supported and compact sizes. `ui/components/Components.h` contains reusable instance-local button, text, list, modal, notification, progress and focus-routing models; AppShell's SETTINGS demonstration owns only temporary instances. `Strings.h` centralizes visible Korean shell messages and the six fixed English tab labels. Shell navigation and components change no audio, plugin parameter, file or persistent state.

## Audio and graphics behavior

`src/audio` is the P02.8 local source foundation. `AudioDecoder` performs byte-level local container inspection and WAV decoding into interleaved float PCM. `AudioDocument` is instance-local and owns only transient source metadata, PCM and structured decode failure state. `tokkebi-audio-core` is linked by each product target but remains independent of iPlug2 graphics and plugin processing. INBOX opens a platform file chooser and loads a selected source into its shell-local document; it neither persists nor plays the data.

`APP_API` selects `0-2`; iPlug2 opens no input stream, and the callback writes only silence. This preserves P00.2.1's microphone-monitoring and feedback protection.

VST3 and AUv2 select `2-2`; their callback copies each connected input channel to the corresponding output and zeros unmatched outputs. It performs no allocation, file operation, network operation or blocking work.

## Bundled typography boundary

`src/app/fonts.h` is the sole font-loading interface. It registers the three
bundled binaries with IGraphics by stable IDs: DungGeunMo for primary text,
RIDIBatang for body text, and Galmuri11Bitmap 2.40.4 for technical text. The
P00.4 smoke screen exercises Korean, Latin and technical strings using only
those IDs. A required-font load failure emits a diagnostic and attaches no
replacement system-font text. The Windows resource script embeds these assets
in the APP and VST3 binaries; the CMake `RESOURCES` list packages them for
macOS bundles.

## Product identity

The user-facing product name is lowercase `tokkebi`. The stable iPlug2 IDs are plugin `Tkb1` and manufacturer `NYN1`; the same values are reflected in VST3/AU resource metadata. The application release is `0.1.0` (`0x00000100`).

## Deliberately absent

P02.8 adds no Helper, user-data store, downloader, preview, waveform processing, IN/OUT selection, export, installer, signing, notarization, host-specific integration or workflow UI redesign. Actual DAW loading remains separate manual validation.
