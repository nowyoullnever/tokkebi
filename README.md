**Status: P02.8.1 — async local WAV load and decoder safety correction.**

`tokkebi` is a cross-platform audio collection and sample-library product in development. P02.8.1 loads a selected WAV asynchronously, reports real detected metadata, and bounds decoded PCM memory. AIFF/AIFC and FLAC are recognized but unsupported. It does not implement preview, waveform, IN/OUT selection, conversion/export, persistence, acquisition or Helper IPC.
